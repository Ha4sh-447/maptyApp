<p>This project is a Map based workout mapping website which I created while learning Javascript. It marks the user workouts (Running and Cycling) on map. The user needs to fill differnt fields based on the type of workout choosen, like distance covered, duration, cadence, elevation, speed, etc.</p>
<p>User can navigate to these workouts by clicking on the workout tabs.</p>
<p>This project uses Leaflet Geolocation API to load the map and perform map related tasks like adding marker and navigating on map.</p>
<p>It uses localStorage to store and manage users existing data and keep track of it.</p>
